# tests/AGENTS.md

The e2e suite (`tests/e2e/`) is the source of truth for what llmlint does. It
drives the **real `llmlint` binary** (via `assert_cmd`) against the deterministic
`llmlint-mock-oneharness` fixture (passed with `--oneharness-bin`), which stands
in for the one genuinely-external boundary. **Never mock llmlint's own logic**
(config load/merge/include, file globbing, template render, batching, voting,
reporting). Add a journey here when a user-facing behavior lands.

## Fixture control (env vars read by the mock)

- `LLMLINT_MOCK_VERDICTS=<path>` — JSON map `rule -> spec`; a spec is a bool
  (`holds`), an object (`{holds, violations}`), or an array of specs (one per
  judge call).
- `LLMLINT_MOCK_STATE=<dir>` — per-rule call counter backing array specs; use
  `--max-parallel 1` so the sequence is deterministic.
- `LLMLINT_MOCK_DUMP=<file>` — record the rendered `--system` prompt, to assert
  which files/rules reached the judge (globbing + template render).
- `LLMLINT_MOCK_FAIL_SCHEMA` / `LLMLINT_MOCK_NO_STRUCTURED` / `LLMLINT_MOCK_GARBAGE`
  — force oneharness failure shapes.
- `LLMLINT_MOCK_DUMP_ARGS=<file>` — record the raw `run` arg vector, to assert
  which flags llmlint passed (e.g. `--harness` omitted when an agent leaves it unset).

## Journeys covered

- All rules hold -> exit 0; a violation -> exit 1 with `file:line: message`.
- Multi-judge majority: a single dissent still passes; a majority dissent fails.
- `include` merges rules from another file; the bundled `llmlint:config-lint`
  plugin catches a bad rule in a config file.
- include/exclude globbing selects the right files; explicit CLI files override
  the config globs; per-rule and per-agent `files` override the global globs.
- `--config` replaces upward discovery and is repeatable (first entry supplies
  the top-level scalars, the rest contribute rules/agents); `config --config`
  honors a relative path resolved against `--cwd`.
- `--cwd` drives both config discovery and the directory forwarded to oneharness
  as its `--cwd`.
- `--rule` and `--agent` filters limit which rules run; an empty selection exits
  0; rules with no matching files are skipped.
- `--timeout` is forwarded to oneharness; the oneharness `model` is forwarded,
  with a per-agent `model` overriding the global default; multiple oneharness
  configs warn and use the first; `--oneharness-bin` resolves from the env.
- An agent's `harness` is forwarded as `--harness`; leaving it unset omits the
  flag so oneharness falls back to its own configured default harness.
- `init` scaffolds a config (and `--with-template`, `--output`, `--global` via
  XDG or the HOME fallback), refuses to clobber without `--force`; `init` then
  self-lint is clean.
- `config` prints the merged config + sources and rejects an invalid config;
  `doctor` reports the oneharness version and fails clearly when it is missing.
- Failure/recovery: missing config, malformed config, duplicate rule names (exit
  2); schema-invalid, missing-structured, unparseable, empty-results, and
  bad-verdict-shape oneharness output are surfaced (exit 2).

## Live tier (`scripts/live-*.sh`)

The hermetic e2e suite above proves llmlint's logic against a mock oneharness. The
**live tier** proves the *real* stack — real `llmlint` → real `oneharness` → a
real, authenticated harness — and is the llmlint analogue of oneharness's own
`scripts/e2e-*.sh`. It is opt-in (`just live-<harness>` / `just live-all`), makes
real (paid) model calls, and is never in `just check` or CI.

- **Skip, never fail:** a missing harness CLI or missing auth is a `SKIP` (exit 0).
  A clean run is *required* once the prerequisites are present — that is the point.
- **Journeys per harness** (`live_run_journeys` in `scripts/live-lib.sh`): scaffold
  a throwaway project with one crisp invariant (`no_todo_comments`) pinned to that
  harness, then (1) a clean `src/lib.rs` must pass → exit 0, rule `pass`; (2) a
  file with a planted `TODO` must be flagged → exit 1, rule `fail`. Exit 2 (the
  live stack could not complete) is a failure, not a skip, since CLI + auth were
  confirmed first.
- **Harness CLI + auth** (skip unless present), matching oneharness:
  `claude-code`→`claude` + `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`|`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`;
  `codex`→`codex` + `OPENAI_API_KEY`;
  `opencode`→`opencode` + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`|`OPENAI_API_KEY`;
  `goose`→`goose` + `OPENAI_API_KEY`; `qwen`→`qwen` + `OPENAI_API_KEY`;
  `crush`→`crush` + `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`|`OPENAI_API_KEY`;
  `copilot`→`copilot` + `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN`;
  `cursor`→`cursor-agent` + `CURSOR_API_KEY`.
- **Overrides:** `<HARNESS>_E2E_MODEL` picks the judge model (claude defaults to
  `haiku`; others use the harness default unless set); `LL_TIMEOUT` (default 120s)
  becomes the config's `oneharness.timeout`; `LLMLINT_BIN` /
  `LLMLINT_ONEHARNESS_BIN` override binary resolution.

## Unit vs e2e

Pure domain logic (validation, planning, voting, schema, rendering, reporting)
and the oneharness client's process handling are unit-tested in-module. The
`#[cfg(unix)]` subprocess timeout/capture tests run on Linux/macOS; the coverage
threshold is therefore enforced on Linux CI (see `AGENTS.md`).
